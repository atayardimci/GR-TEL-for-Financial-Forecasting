# Graph-Regularized Tensor Ensemble Learning for Financial Forecasting

Financial machine learning is a notoriously difficult paradigm characterized by large-dimensional, irregular, and multi-modal data, with exceedingly low signal-to-noise ratio. Standard machine learning methods are ill-equipped to tackle the challenges of modern financial big data, which poses significant problems in terms of computational complexity and learning generalization. In this paper, we investigate a solution to aforementioned problems using modern signal processing techniques based on tensors, tensor decompositions, and graphs. By pursuing a graph-theoretic approach, portfolio cuts, to cluster assets, and by using resulting clusters and notions such as degree centrality, we tensorize financial data samples along certain modes. This way, we introduce a rigorous method for tensorizing multi-dimensional data acquired on irregular domains and equip the resulting tensor representation with more meaning by accounting for the structural dependencies within data, which can be later utilized with tensor decompositions. Then, we use such tensorized data samples in a Tensor Ensemble Learning (TEL) framework to classify stock price movements, benefiting from the ensemble learning abilities of the framework, while exploiting the multi-dimensional structure of the input samples by virtue of tensors and their decompositions. In this process, we propose a new framework called Graph-Regularized Tensor Ensemble Learning (GRTEL) and demonstrate its benefits through numerical simulations based on real-world financial data.
